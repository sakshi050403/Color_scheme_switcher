# Color_scheme_switcher
**Overview**
The Color Scheme Switcher is a simple JavaScript-based tool that enables users to toggle between different color themes on a website. This tool allows web developers to offer a dynamic user experience by switching between predefined themes like "light" and "dark" mode, or any other custom themes you want to include.

The main advantage of this project is its simplicity and the ability to seamlessly integrate theme switching without requiring complex setups or external dependencies. It supports saving user preferences using localStorage, so the theme persists across sessions.

**Features**
Toggle Themes: Switch between multiple color schemes, such as light and dark mode.
Persist Theme Preferences: The selected theme is saved to localStorage, ensuring the userâ€™s preference is remembered on subsequent visits.
Customizable: Easily extend the functionality to support any number of custom themes.
Lightweight & Fast: Minimal JavaScript and no external libraries required.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Works across all modern browsers.
